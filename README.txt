Hello Git and GitHub
This is the first repository that I have created. So this is where my practice content will go before I adventure off and create new repositories for real projects 
that I would like to use for my portfolio. It took some time to get here, it even lead to me getting distracted 
trying to make sure that I did everything I needed to do to have everything working as it should. 
I am very happy with myself for getting this far and the momentum wont stop now !! 
You got this dude!! I believe in you! I have faith in us and the Universe and fully trust in the Universe to guide me where I need to be. Thank you for the effort.
